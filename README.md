<h1>What I Cannot Show You</h1>
 Responsive web based gallery for my <b>What I Cannot Show You</b> film photography set.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
I found myself wanting to share my art online, however, the only options available are major social media platforms that do not allow for art to be arranged in a collection that complements the individual pieces. When walking into a physical museum collections are are arranged with intention and one's attention is drawn solely to the art. I am practicing my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create my idea of making a web-based version of currated gallery and using my own art for this project.

<h3>Design</h3>
<ul>
    <li>scrolling paralax animation effect of images and non-invasive accompanying text</li>
    <li>responsive to mobile and desktop views</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Content</h3>
 The artwork that will be featured are the film photographs that I took on my Canon F1 (1979) with Kodak Porta 400 film. I developed, scanned, and color adjusted the film myself.
