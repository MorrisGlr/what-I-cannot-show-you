# what-I-cannot-show-you
<h1>What I Cannot Show You</h1>
 Responsive web based gallery for my <b>What I Cannot Show You</b> film photography set.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
I found myself wanting to share my art online, however, the only options available are major social media platforms that do not allow for art to be arranged in a collection that complements the individual pieces. When walking into a physical museum collections are are arranged with intention and one's attention is drawn solely to the art. I am practicing my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create my idea of making a web-based version of currated gallery.

<h3>Design</h3>
* responsive to mobile and desktop views
* scrolling paralax animation effect of images and non-invasive accompanying text
